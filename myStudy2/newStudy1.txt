now created in the newStudy1.txt file in the second Repository "myStudy2"
bu still not udated in the GitHub
The procedure is to create the new Repository for "myStudy2" in the GitHub application
go to your home page on your GitHub and create the Repository as above mentioned

now we should update the "myStudy2" and "newStudy1" both are updated in the GitHub how..............

now to use the code "git init" in to the Terminal

We already created in the "myStudy2" repository in the GitHub 

To using the code "git remote add origin" and copy paste the Repository link it will be updated in the vs coed let's try

to using code git add study2.txt or git add .
            Next
    git commit -m "The file was Updated"
            Next
    got push origin main 

but the file not moved what is the reason ????????????

    " error: failed to push some refs to 'origin' "

there is no found main branch origin how to check the branch to use the code "git branch"

now the *master name found instead of main then what we do to change rename as main 

go the another step use the code "git branch -M" main

now check the code to "git branch" the main name will be shown

now you can use the updating process

    
to using code git add study2.txt or git add .
            Next
    git commit -m "The file was Updated"
            Next
    got push origin main
